# Marble-Maze
Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand whatâ€™s going on:

Rewrite the loadLevel() method so that it's made up of multiple smaller methods. This will make your code easier to read and easier to maintain, or at least it should do if you do a good job!
When the player finally makes it to the finish marker, nothing happens. What should happen? Well, that's down to you now. You could easily design several new levels and have them progress through.
Add a new block type, such as a teleport that moves the player from one teleport point to the other. Add a new letter type in loadLevel(), add another collision type to our enum, then see what you can do.
